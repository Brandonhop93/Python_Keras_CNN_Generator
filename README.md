# Python_Keras_CNN_Generator
A convolutional neural network developed in Python and Keras to classify five different classes of flowers. The program features quick parameter specification, data augmentation, early-stopping, model saving and automatic learning rate adjustment. The program can simply be adjusted for another problem by altering the outlined parameters and providing an image data set. Simply place all images in the following folder structure and update validation and training sample counts within the program. E.g. data/train/class1, data/train/class2, data/train/class3, data/valid/class1, ..., etc.

The image below shows one representation of how the program may be configured.
